# What2Ride

A way too overambitioned project to find the best means of vehicular transport for you.
Now with 83% more open-source greatness.

## What does this strange thing actually do?

Good question mysterious internet text... *that I definitely didn't write myself... don't you dare checking the commit history...*

What2Ride is basically a platform to find the best way to get from somewhere to somewhere else.
Type in the start and end of your journey and we do the rest. ðŸ˜‰

But the main thing is that you can find out how much COâ‚‚ emissions you will produce with your journey so you can make an informed decision with the environment in mind.
We understand though that this shouldn't be the only factor that you might consider.

I mean... Let's be honest.
Most of you wouldn't take a ride which would save 5% in emissions if it takes you three times the amount of time to travel and is two times as expensive in comparison.
So as a goal we try to give you the most important metrics with a neutral focus on the enviroment so you can form your own personal informed decision on what to ride.

## Doesn't this stuff already exist somewhere?

Well... Kinda.
You see. All of this information is scattered around the internet in different places which makes it pretty hard to gather and let's be honest.
You don't want to look at five different sites if you just want to find out if it's better to take the train or plane somewhere quickly.
We're also lazy... ðŸ˜…

And if there's a more or less compiled platform where you can look up this kind of stuff it seems to be lacking in different features, metrics and generally run from a rather dubious company. *looking at you Google* ðŸ‘€

We don't want to steal your data and our goal isn't to make *very high denomination* of *your most favorite currency*.
This is just a passion project from us to have some fun, create something cool and maybe even get some fake internet points in the process.

So we don't just make your rides more environmentally sustainable but also your experience using our service sustainable by not indulging in the sad practices of mass data collection/stealing *or whatever you wanna call it...* and making it as neutral and as easy as possible. ðŸ’—

## How can you contribute?

First of all thanks for asking. ðŸ’—

But right now we're in the beginning stages of the project and we need some time got actually get something running.
I mean. This README isn't even finished yet.
So yeah...

More stuff will be coming soon. ðŸ˜‰
